# 🎧 Sound Clustering Assignment – ML Techniques II

This project applies **unsupervised clustering techniques** on an **unlabeled sound dataset** using Mel Spectrogram features and dimensionality reduction. The goal is to explore cluster structures in audio recordings and compare the effectiveness of **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** algorithms.

## 🔍 Tasks Performed

### ✅ Feature Extraction
- Extracted features from `.wav` files using **Mel Spectrograms**.
- Computed statistical descriptors (mean & std) from each Mel frequency band.
- Logged and skipped corrupt files with traceback logs.

### ✅ Raw Feature Visualization
- Visualized raw features using scatter plot & pairplot.
- Observed no visible clusters due to high-dimensional redundancy.

### ✅ Dimensionality Reduction
- Applied **PCA** and **t-SNE** to project features into 3D space.
- t-SNE revealed clearer cluster separation compared to PCA.

### ✅ Clustering & Evaluation
- Applied **K-Means** with optimal k determined using:
  - Elbow Method
  - Silhouette Score
- Applied **DBSCAN** with density-based clustering.
- Evaluated both using:
  - Silhouette Score
  - Davies-Bouldin Index
  - Calinski-Harabasz Index

## 📊 Evaluation Summary

| Algorithm | Silhouette | DB Index | CH Index |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| K-Means (k=4) | 0.2809     | 1.1201   | 1511.15  |
| DBSCAN        | **0.5576** | **0.4994** | 926.81   |

✅ **DBSCAN outperformed K-Means** in terms of internal separation, thanks to its ability to ignore noise and adapt to cluster shapes.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- **Dimensionality reduction** (esp. t-SNE) revealed latent cluster structure.
- **DBSCAN** performed better than K-Means for this type of noisy, high-dimensional sound data.
- Project follows modular principles with reusable functions and clear markdown analysis.
