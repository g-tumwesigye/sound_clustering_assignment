You're absolutely right—your `README.md` can look much more elegant and professional with a few Markdown fixes ✨. Right now, the formatting is off due to mixed characters like `**%` and broken lines. Let me polish it for you:

### ✅ **Improved `README.md` (Copy & Paste this)**

```markdown
# 🎧 Sound Clustering Assignment – ML Techniques II

This project applies **unsupervised clustering techniques** on an **unlabeled sound dataset**, using Mel Spectrogram features for dimensionality reduction and cluster discovery.

## 🔍 Tasks Performed

### ✅ Feature Extraction
- Extracted features from `.wav` files using **Mel Spectrograms**.
- Computed statistical descriptors (mean & std) from each Mel frequency band.
- Logged and skipped corrupt files using exception handling.

### ✅ Raw Feature Visualization
- Visualized raw features using scatter plots and pairplots.
- Observed no visible clusters due to high-dimensional redundancy.

### ✅ Dimensionality Reduction
- Applied **PCA** and **t-SNE** to project features into 3D space.
- **t-SNE** revealed clearer cluster separation compared to PCA.

### ✅ Clustering (K-Means & DBSCAN)
- Evaluated optimal number of clusters using **Elbow** and **Silhouette** methods.
- Compared clustering performance:
  - K-Means (k=4): moderate separation.
  - DBSCAN: better-defined and denser clusters.

### ✅ Evaluation Metrics
- Used **Silhouette Score**, **Davies-Bouldin Index**, and **Calinski-Harabasz Score** to assess clustering quality.
- DBSCAN outperformed K-Means on this dataset.

## 📌 Conclusion

Dimensionality reduction was crucial due to the high-dimensional feature space from Mel spectrograms. **t-SNE** provided more interpretable visualizations. **DBSCAN** handled the noisy structure of audio data better than K-Means, highlighting the importance of algorithm choice in unsupervised learning.
